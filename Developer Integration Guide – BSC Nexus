1. Purpose

This guide explains how developers can connect their own smart contracts or backend services to BSC Nexus for infrastructure testing and quality assurance.
The goal is to help you verify RPC connectivity, token queries, and API reliability before launching on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Mainnet.

Repository: https://github.com/grkhmz23/BSC-Nexus

2. Prerequisites
Requirement	Version	Notes
Node.js	18 or higher	Required for running tests
npm	9 or higher	Package manager
Git	Latest	For cloning the repository
A deployed contract	Optional	On BSC Mainnet or Testnet
3. Setup
3.1 Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/grkhmz23/BSC-Nexus.git
cd BSC-Nexus
npm install

3.2 Configure environment

Create a .env file with your details:

SERVER_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
WS_URL=wss://your-backend-url.com
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/bsc_nexus
BSC_RPC_URL=https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/


If you want to test on Mainnet:

BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org

4. Running the QA suite
Start the mock backend
node mock-server.mjs

Run the tests
npm test


When complete, open the generated report:

test-report.html

5. Connecting your own smart contract

You can create a new test file (for example tests/contract.ts) to query your deployed contract directly.

Example: Verify totalSupply and owner address
import axios from "axios";
import { TestResult } from "../types.js";

export async function testMyContract(config): Promise<TestResult[]> {
  const start = Date.now();
  const contract = "0xYourContractAddress";
  const dataTotalSupply = "0x18160ddd"; // totalSupply()
  const dataOwner = "0x8da5cb5b";      // owner()

  try {
    const rpc = config.bscRpcUrl;

    const [supply, owner] = await Promise.all([
      axios.post(rpc, { jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "eth_call", params: [{ to: contract, data: dataTotalSupply }, "latest"], id: 1 }),
      axios.post(rpc, { jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "eth_call", params: [{ to: contract, data: dataOwner }, "latest"], id: 2 })
    ]);

    const results: TestResult[] = [
      {
        name: "Contract totalSupply",
        passed: !!supply.data.result,
        duration: Date.now() - start,
        details: `totalSupply: ${supply.data.result}`,
      },
      {
        name: "Contract owner()",
        passed: !!owner.data.result,
        duration: Date.now() - start,
        details: `owner: ${owner.data.result}`,
      },
    ];

    return results;
  } catch (error: any) {
    return [{
      name: "Contract Integration Test",
      passed: false,
      duration: Date.now() - start,
      error: error.message,
      suggestion: "Verify RPC URL and contract address."
    }];
  }
}


Then register it inside test-runner.ts:

import { testMyContract } from "./tests/contract.js";

const testSuites = [
  { name: "Health Checks", fn: () => testHealth(config) },
  { name: "RPC Proxy", fn: () => testRPC(config) },
  { name: "My Contract", fn: () => testMyContract(config) },
];


Re-run:

npm test


Your report will include the new contract results.

6. Testing without deployment

You can also test infrastructure without deploying a contract by:

Using the mock backend (mock-server.mjs)

Calling public BSC nodes through the QA suite

Simulating responses with JSON-RPC payloads

This validates RPC formatting, connection stability, and backend routing before actual deployment.

7. Switching between networks
Network	RPC URL	Purpose
BSC Testnet	https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/	Safe testing; no real funds
BSC Mainnet	https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org	Live network; real tokens

Switch by editing BSC_RPC_URL in your .env file.

8. Common Errors and Fixes
Issue	Cause	Resolution
Timeout or “Network Error”	RPC node unavailable	Switch to another RPC URL
result: null from eth_call	Wrong method or contract	Verify function selectors and address
“Cannot read property of undefined”	Missing .env variable	Check configuration values
Health check fails	Server not running	Start mock-server.mjs first
9. Best Practices

Always test on BSC Testnet before deploying to Mainnet.

Keep .env variables private; never commit secrets.

Save the latest test-report.html to track QA results over time.

Add your new tests to version control to maintain traceability.

10. Next Steps

Extend test coverage for events, transactions, and token transfers.

Integrate the QA suite into your CI/CD pipeline.

Deploy a live Nexus instance to act as your RPC monitoring service.
