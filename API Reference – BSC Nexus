1. Overview

The BSC Nexus backend exposes a series of REST and JSON-RPC endpoints used for infrastructure monitoring and blockchain data access.
This reference defines the currently implemented routes, expected payloads, and response formats.

Base URL examples:

Environment	URL
Local	http://localhost:3000
GitHub Codespaces	https://potential-telegram-g4454grx77rw3x9x.github.dev
Replit (example)	https://bsc-nexus.repl.co

All endpoints use JSON responses and follow standard HTTP status codes.

2. /health – Service Health Check
Method
GET /health

Description

Verifies that the backend is operational.
Used by QA tests and monitoring tools to confirm basic service uptime.

Example Request
curl https://bsc-nexus.repl.co/health

Example Response
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Mock BSC Nexus backend is healthy ✅"
}

Response Codes
Code	Meaning
200 OK	Service operational
500 Internal Server Error	Backend unavailable
3. /rpc – JSON-RPC Proxy
Method
POST /rpc

Description

Accepts JSON-RPC 2.0 requests and forwards them to the configured Binance Smart Chain node.
Used to validate request formatting and connection stability.

Example Request
curl -X POST https://bsc-nexus.repl.co/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "eth_blockNumber",
        "params": [],
        "id": 1
      }'

Example Response
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x135f24a"
}

Response Codes
Code	Meaning
200 OK	Valid response from upstream RPC
400 Bad Request	Invalid JSON-RPC format
502 Bad Gateway	Upstream RPC node unreachable
4. /tokens – Token Information (Planned)
Method
POST /tokens

Description

Retrieves token information from the Binance Smart Chain using eth_call.
Queries standard BEP-20 functions such as name, symbol, decimals, and totalSupply.

Example Request
curl -X POST https://bsc-nexus.repl.co/tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "address": "0xYourTokenAddress"
      }'

Example Response
{
  "name": "SampleToken",
  "symbol": "STK",
  "decimals": 18,
  "totalSupply": "1000000000000000000000000"
}

Response Codes
Code	Meaning
200 OK	Token data successfully retrieved
404 Not Found	Contract address invalid or unreachable
500 Internal Server Error	RPC error during query
5. /webhooks – Webhook Listener (Planned)
Method
POST /webhooks

Description

Receives event notifications from external services or on-chain triggers.
Planned for integration with future real-time monitoring features.

6. WebSocket Endpoint
URL
wss://bsc-nexus.repl.co

Description

Real-time connection for event streaming and RPC subscription testing.
Supports basic eth_subscribe and eth_unsubscribe requests in JSON-RPC 2.0 format.

Example Payload
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_subscribe",
  "params": ["newHeads"]
}

7. Error Format

All errors follow a consistent structure:

{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid JSON-RPC request format",
    "details": "Missing required 'method' field"
  }
}

8. Environment Configuration

Environment variables define how requests are routed and which blockchain node is used.

Variable	Description
SERVER_URL	Base URL of the backend API
WS_URL	WebSocket endpoint for streaming
DATABASE_URL	Optional PostgreSQL connection string
BSC_RPC_URL	Upstream RPC provider (Mainnet or Testnet)

Example .env:

SERVER_URL=https://bsc-nexus.repl.co
WS_URL=wss://bsc-nexus.repl.co
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/bsc_nexus
BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org

9. Testing Endpoints

You can test all endpoints manually using curl, Postman, or by running the automated suite:

npm test


Output example:

Total Tests:  4
Passed:       4 (100.0%)
Failed:       0 (0.0%)
Duration:     0.47s


The QA report will be generated as test-report.html.
